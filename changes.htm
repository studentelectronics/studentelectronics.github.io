                    Changes Made Since Assignment 4 (CP202)</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>The color scheme is still following a triadic scheme, but we have changed the 	background from 						off-white to white to make the pages look cleaner, as well as changing the original dark grey for 							containers to a dull purple to add color to the site. As well, each page has its own featured deal, which has a unique color scheme for each page.</li>
                    <br />
                    <li>Got rid of breadcrumb trail, as our site structure is very shallow and there is a very low chance 							of the user getting lost. We felt that a breadcrumb trail would take away from the content as it 							would be redundent.</li>
                    <br />
                    <li>Changed "Deals of the Day" to "Deals of the Week" on the home page as more often deals last one 						week rather than one day.</li>
                    <br />
                    <li>Opted for a top navigation bar instead of a side bar for style purposes.</li>
                    <br />
                    <li>Scrapped the filters using checkboxes on each category page, as this would need Javascript, which 						was not taught in this course. Additionally, we felt filters weren't neccesary for the number of items on each page.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Ran index.html and laptop.html in 
                        <strong>W3C Validator</strong>, as laptop.html is very similar to the category pages, only one category page was run.

                        <li>Provide a help link on ever Web page - AAA (index.html and laptop.html) - Our page does not have a help page.</li>
                        <li>Data table must have one row of header - A (laptop.html) - There are no neccessary headers needed for our table, as a caption is used as a table title.</li>
                        <li>Use scope attribute to associate header cells - A (laptop.html) - We do not use headers in our table.</li>
